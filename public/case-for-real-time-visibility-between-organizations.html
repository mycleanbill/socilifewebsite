				    <p> Social services that directly or indirectly help individuals’ health are delivered through a variety of entities in a complex environment. Not for profits, government organizations, health systems, religious organizations and others come together to deliver these services to Medicaid beneficiaries. While the intent of all involved organizations is noble, the delivery of services may not be well coordinated resulting in administrative wastage and inefficiencies. </p>
				    
				    <p> Let’s consider the importance of real-time visibility into schedules (in other words shared calendars) of different organizations using examples. 
					</p>

				    <p> He currently lives in an apartment and pays $1000 per month rent (leaving him with $200 per month for everything else). His goal is to move to public housing (like his brother). We asked him why he wouldn't share his apartment with a roommate, but he avoided that question (we would later find out why). He showed to us the housing application (he calls it “app”) that he had filled a month ago but had not submitted to the Seattle Housing Authority. We again asked him why not and he said because he couldn’t pay for transportation.  </p>

				    <p>For instance, a beneficiary visiting a food bank for groceries may interact with a social worker who recognizes the need for a doctor’s visit for that beneficiary. However, if the social worker does not have access to the calendars of clinics and hospitals in the area, she might need to make a phone call to the clinic or hospital to get an appointment – wasting valuable resources and time on both ends of the phone line. Even worse, the social worker may leave it up to the individual to schedule the appointment missing an opportunity for early intervention. 
					</p>

				    <p> Most had wait times of 3-4 years or longer. John was going to have to wait a long time before he could move into his state aid assigned apartment. On top of that, while waiting, he would need to check-in monthly with the housing authority via the internet, phone or in person. If he failed to check-in, his application would be canceled. John has a government supplied phone that is only good for making phone calls and sending/receiving text messages. He doesn’t have the internet on his phone - not that it would have mattered. He has never used a computer or internet in his life and doesn't know what Google is (he knows about Amazon because he has seen commercials on TV). We couldn’t offer to check-in on his behalf as the system requires his SSN to be keyed in, and we didn’t want to have his SSN. </p>

				    <p> On the other hand, hospitals may also need access to calendars of Medicaid approved transportation agencies in their service area. A hospital may be discharging a patient who needs transportation to their home. 
					</p>

				    <p>Without the visibility into the transportation agency’s schedule in real-time, the hospital may need a dedicated coordinator to review a list of Medicaid patient discharges for the day and plan for their transportation needs. Due to limited availability of Medicaid approved vehicles, any changes to the vehicle schedule due to unavoidable delays in picking up patients may throw the entire system off (including multiple hospitals in service area). Population health managers at hospitals would be forced to pick between an expensive delay in discharge and arranging for an ambulance on their own – in either case increasing the cost of healthcare.
